## Quick start: On-ramp, Validator, Contracts

1) Start a validator node

```bash
node sdupi_validator_node.js --validator --id validator-1 --rpc-port 8545 --port 3001
```

2) Start the on-ramp faucet

```bash
bash scripts/start_onramp.sh
```

3) Deploy and execute a sample contract

```bash
SDUPI_RPC=http://localhost:8545 node scripts/deploy_sample_contract.js
```

Faucet endpoints:
- GET http://localhost:8082/faucet/status
- POST http://localhost:8082/faucet/request { "address": "<addr>", "amount": 100 }
