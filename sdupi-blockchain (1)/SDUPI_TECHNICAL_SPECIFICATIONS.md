# SDUPI Blockchain - Complete Technical Specifications
## Mathematical Formulas, Gas Fees, and Technical Parameters

### 1. BLOCKCHAIN MATHEMATICAL FORMULAS

#### 1.1 DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) Mathematics

**DAG Node Weight Calculation:**
```
W(n) = α × T(n) + β × S(n) + γ × C(n) + δ × P(n)

Where:
- W(n) = Node weight
- T(n) = Transaction count in node
- S(n) = Stake amount of validator
- C(n) = Cumulative weight of parent nodes
- P(n) = Priority score (0-100)
- α, β, γ, δ = Weight coefficients (α=0.4, β=0.3, γ=0.2, δ=0.1)
```

**Tip Selection Algorithm:**
```
P(tip) = W(tip) / Σ W(all_tips)

Where:
- P(tip) = Probability of selecting a tip
- W(tip) = Weight of the tip
- Σ W(all_tips) = Sum of all tip weights
```

**Conflict Resolution Score:**
```
CRS(tx1, tx2) = Σ (W(ancestor) × distance_factor) / max_distance

Where:
- CRS = Conflict Resolution Score
- ancestor = Common ancestor nodes
- distance_factor = 1 / (distance + 1)
- max_distance = Maximum path length in DAG
```

#### 1.2 Consensus Mathematics

**HotStuff Consensus:**
```
View Change: v' = (v + 1) mod (3f + 1)
Where f = maximum faulty nodes

Three-Phase Commit:
- Prepare: 2f + 1 votes required
- Pre-commit: 2f + 1 votes required  
- Commit: 2f + 1 votes required

Finality: 2 rounds = 2 × (3f + 1) messages
```

**Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT):**
```
Safety: 2f + 1 honest nodes required
Liveness: 3f + 1 total nodes required
Where f = number of faulty nodes

Consensus Round Time: T = 2 × (network_latency + processing_time)
```

**AI Consensus Predictor:**
```
Prediction Score = Σ (w_i × f_i(x)) / Σ w_i

Where:
- w_i = Weight of neural network layer i
- f_i(x) = Output of layer i for input x
- x = Current network state vector
```

#### 1.3 Cryptography Mathematics

**Ed25519 Signature:**
```
Private Key: d ∈ {0,1}^256
Public Key: Q = d × G
Where G is the base point on Curve25519

Signature: (R, s) where:
R = r × G
s = r + H(R||Q||m) × d mod l
Where l is the order of the base point
```

**ZK-STARKs Proof Generation:**
```
Polynomial Commitment: P(x) = Σ a_i × x^i
Where a_i are coefficients

Proof: π = (P(ω), P(ω²), ..., P(ω^n))
Where ω is a primitive nth root of unity

Verification: e(P(ω), g) = e(π, g^ω)
```

**Quantum-Resistant Kyber:**
```
Key Generation: (pk, sk) = Gen()
Where pk = A × s + e, sk = s
A is random matrix, s, e are error vectors

Encryption: c = (u, v) where:
u = A^T × r + e1
v = pk^T × r + e2 + m
```

#### 1.4 Performance Mathematics

**Throughput Calculation:**
```
TPS = (block_size × blocks_per_second) / average_transaction_size

Where:
- block_size = 1MB (configurable)
- blocks_per_second = 1 / block_time
- block_time = 0.5 seconds (target)
- average_transaction_size = 250 bytes

Target: 50,000+ TPS
```

**Latency Calculation:**
```
Total Latency = T_propagation + T_validation + T_consensus + T_finality

Where:
- T_propagation = network_latency (target: <2ms)
- T_validation = transaction_validation_time (target: <3ms)
- T_consensus = consensus_round_time (target: <3ms)
- T_finality = finality_confirmation (target: <2ms)

Total Target: <10ms
```

**Scalability Formula:**
```
Scalability Factor = (parallel_workers × batch_size) / (memory_pool_size × processing_time)

Where:
- parallel_workers = 16 (configurable)
- batch_size = 1000 transactions
- memory_pool_size = 100MB

Target: 1M+ TPS by 2027

Where:
